                <p> Hi!</p>
                <p> I'm Zach, a UC Berkeley Student currently studying Civil and Environmental Engineering. I also love
                    taking pictures, camping with friends, and cooking a warm meal (which I can do all at the same time!)
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I first started taking pictures on a Nintendo DSi. After beating Pokemon Diamond,
                    I began snapping pictures of Arches National Park with the 0.3 megapixel
                    best of a camera on the DSi. Since then, I've been hooked, and I will always be
                    looking to capture awesome memories from my adventures!
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Photography is a way for me to capture experiences and have a great time
                    with lovely people. Through photography, I hope to make everyone look their best,
                    create intriguing art, and capture timeless memories. If you love staring at stars,
                    toasting marshmellos by a fire, or just aimlessly exploring a city, then we'd make
                    great friends!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's go shoot sometimes! <a href = "contact.html"> Contact me</a>
                    and let's talk!
                </p>
                <p>Fun Fact About Me:</p>
                <p>1. I'm born in Canada. I moved to California in grade school, and have
                been here ever since.
                </p>
                <p>2. My favorite snack is maple flavored yogurt. It's great, you shoudl try it.</p>
                <p>3. I listen to a lot of Electronic Pop. I actually enjoy the lyrics, in addition to
                    the banging drops.
                </p>
                <p>4. I did pole vaulting for a year in high school.</p>
